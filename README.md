# Pulse Point BI Analysis

Business Intelligence Data Analysis Portfolio Project: If I were to re-start my personal training business, what changes would I make and why? This project aims to not only estimate the answer to that question, but to solidify technical, analytical and communication skills I aspire to use in my career. Certain data in this analysis is hypothetical as it is based on a combination of records I could find and my memories to fill in the gaps. I'd love to continue using this project as a foundation for skills training.

## Project Objectives
