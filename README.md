# Pulse Point BI Analysis

Business Intelligence Portfolio Project: How well did I run my business when I was working self-employed? This project aims to not only estimate the answer to that question, but to solidify technical, analytical and communication skills I aspire to use in my career. Most of the data in this analysis is incomplete and based on records I could find from the past. However, I'd love to continue using this project as a foundation for skills training, in which case I'll flush out the database with fictitious data to allow for continued productive use.

## Project Objectives

Main

- [x] Transform handwritten information collected while working self-employed into data tables
- [x] Create relational database to efficiently query information for quick insights
- [x] Prepare and clean data in MySQL (see prep_data.sql)
- [x] Generate interesting insights (see insights.sql)
- [ ] Develop interesting visuals using Microsoft Power BI based on KPIs and other interesting metrics
- [ ] Document business insights including visuals to assess the health of business
- [ ] Include recommendations for improvements based on data analysis

Optional

- [ ] Flush out database with fictitious data to practice specific case studies and prepare for interviews
