# Pulse Point BI Analysis

This Power BI project analyzed over six years of operational and financial data from my sole proprietorship as a personal trainer. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I built a dashboard showcasing key metrics such as customer demographics, service type revenue share, and client loyalty patterns. The analysis uncovered powerful insights: repeat customers accounted for over 96% of total revenue, and referrals made up 83%. These findings could be used to shape retention, referral programs, and high-impact customer engagement strategies.
